// The chain reader — LAYERED_PROFILE.md 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6.
//
// openPikeletChain() mounts a base plus zero or more layers and serves them as
// one corpus. It does NOT reimplement the container: every member is opened
// through openPikeletFile(), which is decision 1 — "a reader that implements the
// complete profile implements this one by adding the chain logic of section 5,
// not a second container parser."
//
// What this file adds on top of those opens:
//   - chain resolution and ancestry verification (5.1 steps 1-2, 3.2, 3.3)
//   - the interval table, per-tier masks and chain state (5.1 step 4)
//   - a query() that generates candidates per search tier with that tier's
//     mask supplied to the scan, merges by distance, and fuses once (5.3)
//   - record()/citation resolution over global ids (5.6)
//
// The caller may supply every member base-first, or just the head and let the
// reader walk up to the base through 5.1.1's parent resolution: a caller-
// supplied lineage map (section 7), then each layer's confined
// `parent.locator`, then a host resolver. The lineage map is the cheaper path
// when available, since every location is known up front and members open in
// one wave; the locator walk is sequential by nature, because each hop's
// location is only known once its child's manifest has been read.
//
// This comment used to claim locator following "is wired". It was not: this
// module did not import layer-locator.mjs at all, so every ancestor had to be
// named by the caller and a published chain could not be mounted from its head.
