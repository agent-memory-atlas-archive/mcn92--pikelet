// `rebase` — LAYERED_PROFILE.md 6.2.
//
// Two producers appending to the same parent create a fork. Both chains are
// valid; the ref names one head. The other layer is re-based onto it: its rows,
// sketches, records, postings and bloom are copied verbatim (nothing is
// re-embedded, local ids do not change), and its rowBase, bitset, supersessions
// and evaluation material are recomputed.
//
// The correctness rule the spec was revised twice to get right:
//
//   A rebase replays what the layer ITSELF did -- its delta over its old
//   parent, and the edges physically in its own segment -- and NEVER its
//   cumulative bitset. T_L contains every deletion any ancestor on the old
//   branch performed; replaying it would import those ancestors' operations
//   into a branch that never performed them, and worse, import an ancestor's
//   tombstone without that ancestor's supersession edge: half of one operation.
//
// To compute the delta, the rebase MUST open L's ORIGINAL parent. If that
// artifact is unavailable the delta is unknowable and the rebase must refuse --
// it cannot be reconstructed from L alone.
